# Problem 1 :
# Write a python program to add to numbers
a = 45
b = 4
print("a = ", a)
print("b = ", b)
print("The sum of a and b is : ", a + b)


# Problem 2 :
# Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by 2.
c = 45
d = 2
print("Reminder when a is divided by b is :", a % b)


# Problem 3 :
# Check the type of variable assigned by input () function.\
e = input("Enter the value of a :")
print(type(a))

# Propblem 4 : 
# Use comparison operator to find out whether a given variable f is greater then g or not. Take f = 30 or g = 80. 
f = 30
g = 80
print(f > g)

# Problem 5 :
# Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
h = float(input("Enter number 1 :"))
i = float(input("Enter number 2 :"))
print("The average of two number is :", (h + i) / 2)


# problem 6:
# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user
j = int(input("Enter number 1 :"))
print("The square of two number is :", j ** 2)
